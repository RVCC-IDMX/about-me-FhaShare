            <h2>About Me:</h2>

            <div>
                <p>My father gave me the nickname "Fha," which means "sky of blue color" in Thai. I find this name very
                    meaningful because the sky can evoke different emotions in people, just like how people's moods can
                    change throughout the day. Even if you have a bad day, there will always be something good about it.
                    Remember that every day is an opportunity to experience something beautiful, like the ever-changing
                    sky.</p>

                <p>As the sky changes, so do I. I used to work as a psychologist, but after arriving in America, I
                    discovered my interest in programming. Specifically, I had previously considered website development
                    but had been unsuccessful in my attempts. However, after taking this course, I realized that website
                    development involves many complex elements. Despite the challenges, I persevered and committed to
                    constant improvement. I am pursuing a career as a software developer and exploring the potential of
                    AI.</p>

            <h2>An Excerpt From Pride and Prejudice</h2>

            <div>
                <p>I am by no means of the opinion, I assure you,” said he, “that a ball of this kind, given by a young
                    man of character, to respectable people, can have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting
                    to dancing myself, that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the
                    course of the evening; and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two
                    first dances especially, a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right
                    cause, and not to any disrespect for her.”</p>

                <p>Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in. She had fully proposed being engaged by Mr. Wickham for
                    those very dances; and to have Mr. Collins instead! her liveliness had never been worse timed. There
                    was no help for it, however. Mr. Wickham’s happiness and her own were perforce delayed a little
                    longer, and Mr. Collins’s proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could. She was not the
                    better pleased with his gallantry from the idea it suggested of something more. It now first struck
                    her, that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being mistress of Hunsford Parsonage,
                    and of assisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors. The
                    idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself, and heard
                    his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than
                    gratified herself by this effect of her charms, it was not long before her mother gave her to
                    understand that the probability of their marriage was extremely agreeable to her. Elizabeth,
                    however, did not choose to take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the
                    consequence of any reply. Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and till he did, it was useless to
                    quarrel about him.</p>

                <p>If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the younger Miss Bennets would
                    have been in a very pitiable state at this time, for from the day of the invitation, to the day of
                    the ball, there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once. No aunt,
                    no officers, no news could be sought after--the very shoe-roses for Netherfield were got by proxy.
                    Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the
                    improvement of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than a dance on Tuesday, could
                    have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday endurable to Kitty and Lydia.</p>

                <p>Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and looked in vain for Mr. Wickham among the
                    cluster of red coats there assembled, a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her. The
                    certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not
                    unreasonably have alarmed her. She had dressed with more than usual care, and prepared in the
                    highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was
                    not more than might be won in the course of the evening. But in an instant arose the dreadful
                    suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr. Darcy’s pleasure in the Bingleys’ invitation to the
                    officers; and though this was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced
                    by his friend Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and who told them that Wickham had been obliged
                    to go to town on business the day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant
                    smile, “I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if he had not wanted to
                    avoid a certain gentleman here.”</p>

                <p>This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by Elizabeth, and, as it assured
                    her that Darcy was not less answerable for Wickham’s absence than if her first surmise had been
                    just, every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment,
                    that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly
                    afterwards approached to make. Attendance, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham.
                    She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away with a degree of
                    ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind
                    partiality provoked her.</p>

                <p>But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for
                    the evening, it could not dwell long on her spirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte
                    Lucas, whom she had not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the
                    oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular notice. The first two dances,
                    however, brought a return of distress; they were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and
                    solemn, apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being aware of it, gave her
                    all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give. The moment of
                    her release from him was ecstasy.</p>

                <p>She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of Wickham, and of hearing that
                    he was universally liked. When those dances were over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in
                    conversation with her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy who took her so much
                    by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without knowing what she did, she accepted him.
                    He walked away again immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind;
                    Charlotte tried to console her:</p>

                <p>"I dare say you will find him very agreeable.”</p>

                <p>Heaven forbid! That would be the greatest misfortune of all! To find a man agreeable whom one is
                    determined to hate! Do not wish me such an evil.”</p>
