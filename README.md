## Welcome to My About Me Project: 

My name is Fhaungfha Suvannakajorn, but my AKA is Fha Share. Feel free to call me Fha.

This project is a part of my IDMX 225 - WEB PAGE DEVELOPMENT I course at Raritan Valley Community College during the Fall 2023 semester. It represents my first expertise in web design using HTML and CSS in Visual Studio Code. I've learned the essentials of website structure and design from this course. This project reflects my interests and hobbies, showcased through various sections like the image gallery and biography. Explore this website to see my web development skills and learn about my personal life.

## Description:
**Navigation:** This section is where I've created a user-friendly navigation system. It features a responsive design, a traditional navigation bar for larger screens, and a hamburger menu for mobile devices. This area is not just functional but also stylish, incorporating a personalized webpage title and logo.

**Profile:** The profile section includes a headline and prominent image, creating a visually compelling introduction. I added some creativity by using the hover effect on my profile picture.

**About Me:** I have experience in typography and hyperlinking. I can create and style detailed paragraphs and manipulate link states using pseudo-classes like ": hover" and ": active." In Hobbies, I am skilled in organizing content using unordered lists with titles and elaborative paragraphs. I use the ": child" pseudo-class to give styling to the list's elements.

**Gallery:** The Photo Gallery uses a <figure> tag for each image and a <figcaption> element for a concise description. This offers context and improves the storytelling aspect of my photographs.

**A Story:** This excerpt from "Pride and Prejudice" showcases my interest in literature and my skills in formatting text for web presentation. The section uses HTML and CSS to enhance readability, with justified paragraphs and styled drop caps. The design is also responsive for a comfortable reading experience on different devices. In the "A Short Video" part, I have learned how to embed a YouTube video into a web page using an iFrame. This is a great way to show how multimedia content can be integrated seamlessly and made accessible to users. To embed the video, I used the <iframe> tag and set attributes to ensure a responsive design that maintains the video's aspect ratio and adapts to different screen sizes.

**My Blog:** The "My Blog" section showcases my skills in creating engaging web content about my journey through America's National Parks through an expanding image gallery that is fully responsive, interactive, and informative. The blog entries are written in a narrative style that blends personal stories with technical insights. The section demonstrates my proficiency in using HTML and CSS to structure and style content, enhancing the blog's visual appeal.

**Contact Form:** The functional contact form facilitates user interaction and collects data efficiently.

## Color Scheme:
The "Color Scheme" section of "About Me: Fha Share" adopts an inclusive approach to color selection. I utilized Adobe's color theme tool to create a visually appealing and color-blind safe palette. Additionally, I conducted color contrast checks to ensure that it met the required standards. I chose the sky color as the theme related to my nickname.

Color Palette Features
The color scheme uses hexadecimal color codes, ensuring precision and consistency across all web platforms. The primary colors used are:
Deep Blue: #002C66 - Provides a robust and confident base color.
Bright Blue: #348BFF - Adds a vibrant, energetic touch.
Light Blue: #90D6FF - Offers a calming, softer contrast.
Sky Blue: #D9F1FF - Serves as a gentle, airy background tone.
White: #FFFFFF - Ensures clean, clear spaces and readability.

In website design, consistent use of colors for backgrounds, fonts, and borders creates visual harmony. Clear CSS classes facilitate easy design maintenance.
